A simple traffic simulation using Nav Mesh. Constrains NavMeshAgents within lanes between custom navigation sections. All traffic moves continuously between randomly selected destinations.

Road Vehicle Traffic:
- Modular road section based randomized navigation
- Junction logic
- Obstactle logic

Pedestrian Traffic:
- Point to point based randomized navigation
- Junction crossing logic

Train Traffic:
- Continuous navigation
- Junction crossing logic

Junctions:
- Crossroad
- T Junction
- Train Crossing
- Pedestrian crossing

Debug
- Junction logic gizmos
- Vehicle traffic destination gizmos

Contains:
- Simple traffic navigation logic
- Nav Mesh Components
- Demo scene
